## Projects
<h3 style="font-size: 18px;">High Resolution European Land Use and Cover Map (ELULC-10)</h3>

[Publication](https://doi.org/10.3390/rs14133041)

<div style="text-align: justify;">
<p>
ELULC-10 used European Sentinel-1/-2 and Landsat-8 images, as well as the LUCAS reference samples. More than 200 K and 300 K of in situ surveys and images, respectively, were employed as inputs in the Google Earth Engine (GEE) cloud computing platform to perform classification by an object-based segmentation algorithm and an Artificial Neural Network (ANN). A novel ANN-based data preparation was also presented to remove noisy reference samples from the LUCAS dataset.

### Ocean Water Quality Monitoring using Remote Sensing Techniques
[Publication](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.marenvres.2022.105701)

Remote Sensing offers significant opportunities for monitoring water quality in estuaries, coastal waterways, and the ocean. OWQ parameters monitored by RS systems and techniques: chlorophyll-a, colored dissolved organic matter, turbidity or total suspended matter/solid, dissolved organic carbon, Secchi disk depth, suspended sediment concentration, and sea surface temperature.
