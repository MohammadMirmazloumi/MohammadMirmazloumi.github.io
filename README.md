## Projects
### ELULC-10
[Publication](https://doi.org/10.3390/rs14133041)

ELULC-10 used European Sentinel-1/-2 and Landsat-8 images, as well as the LUCAS reference samples. More than 200 K and 300 K of in situ surveys and images, respectively, were employed as inputs in the Google Earth Engine (GEE) cloud computing platform to perform classification by an object-based segmentation algorithm and an Artificial Neural Network (ANN). A novel ANN-based data preparation was also presented to remove noisy reference samples from the LUCAS dataset.

### ADM-Kenya
[Website](https://www.admkenya.eu/)

co-developing solutions for monitoring crop condition and cropping systems with Earth Observation (EO) data to derive evidence-based quantitative vegetation condition estimates with high spatial and temporal resolution.

### Early Warning Detection
[Publication](https://doi.org/10.1007/s10064-023-03388-w)

A technical support to early warning detection tools of ground instabilities using deep learning and InSAR time series that is capable of forecasting regions affected by potential collapses.
