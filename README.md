## Projects
<h3 style="font-size: 18px;">High Resolution European Land Use and Cover Map (ELULC-10)</h3>

[Publication](https://doi.org/10.3390/rs14133041)

<div style="text-align: justify;">
<p>
ELULC-10 used European Sentinel-1/-2 and Landsat-8 images, as well as the LUCAS reference samples. More than 200 K and 300 K of in situ surveys and images, respectively, were employed as inputs in the Google Earth Engine (GEE) cloud computing platform to perform classification by an object-based segmentation algorithm and an Artificial Neural Network (ANN). A novel ANN-based data preparation was also presented to remove noisy reference samples from the LUCAS dataset.

### Global Soil Moisture Monitoring
[Publication](https://doi.org/10.3390/rs14184624)

A comparative analysis of SMAP/Sentinel-1 soil moisture product and in situ measurements, for the time period March 2015 to January 2022, from 35 dense and sparse SM networks and 561 stations distributed around the world. Examining the effects of land cover, vegetation fraction, water bodies, urban areas, soil characteristics, and seasonal climatic conditions on the performance of active–passive SMAP/Sentinel-1 in estimating the SM.

### Ocean Water Quality Monitoring using Remote Sensing Techniques
[Publication](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.marenvres.2022.105701)

Remote Sensing offers significant opportunities for monitoring water quality in estuaries, coastal waterways, and the ocean. OWQ parameters monitored by RS systems and techniques: chlorophyll-a, colored dissolved organic matter, turbidity or total suspended matter/solid, dissolved organic carbon, Secchi disk depth, suspended sediment concentration, and sea surface temperature.
